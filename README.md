# Ticket System for Tech Support
This application supports all the basic functionality for administrators to manage their issues and for customers to place issues. It utilizes the twilio text messaging api on the admin side.  

##Login page
Both the Admins and Customers can log in to their respective accounts from here. There is a register user option, which can only be used to add new customer accounts. There is also a forgot password option that will send an email to an address on file to reset the password.


## Admin Functionality
On the admin page, tickets can be viewed in a table by hitting one of three buttons (View All Tickets, View My Tickets, and View Unassigned). The resulting table can be sorted by Ticket #, Time Received, Sender Name, Sender Email, Subject, Assigned Admin, and Status. There is also an option to change passwords and logout.

Specifics of the an individual ticket can be viewed by clicking on it. This will reveal the body of the ticket, along with 8 options: Toggle Status, Toggle Assignment, Email Sender, Delete Ticket, Ticket from Sender, Find Similar Tickets, Message Sender, Go Back to Admin.

## Testing
To test this application, the following dummy users can be used. Please note that the following application was tested on XAMPP.

Admin: <br />
username: Kane354 <br />
password: Kane

Customer: <br />
username: Fake1354 <br />
password: Fake1

Testing Email Account: <br />
username: testingemail354@gmail.com <br />
password: TicketingSystem

To test this application, the following values may need to be set:

In forget.php, line 21, assure that the correct location to resetPassword.php is set. The below shows the current assumption.
$url = "http://localhost/TicketingSystem/src/resetPassword.php/?id="."$id"; <br />

In messages.php, the Twilio account information must be set.
Line 4: "AccountSid" must be set <br />
Line 5: "AuthToken" must be set <br />
Line 7: "from" phone number must be set <br />

Note: All of the Ajax requests in both user pages are done through processUser.php
